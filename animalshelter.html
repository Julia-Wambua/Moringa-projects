        <h1>Kiambu Animal Shelter</h1>
        <p>Animal shelters are crucial community resources that provide temporary homes, food, and medical care for lost, abandoned, and surrendered pets, acting as vital safe havens from streets and neglect, while also facilitating adoptions to give animals second chances and combat pet overpopulation by connecting them with loving families, though they often face challenges like overcrowding and limited resources. </p>

    </div>


    <p>In this spirit, the shelter is giving up some of its animals for adoption in an attempt to offer them loving homes that they were once deprived of.</p>\

        <p id="p1">Rabbits are mammals, which are warm blooded animals with backbones. They like to live in groups and dig tunnels under the ground to protect themselves.

    <div class="card">
        <li>3. Brown cat</li>
        <img id="h1" src="Arwen.jpg" alt="">
        <p id="p1">A light brown cat, often described as having a cinnamon, tan, or fawn coat, offers a warm and gentle aesthetic that stands out from more common feline colors. While solid light brown is quite rare, this coloring is frequently seen in breeds like the Abyssinian, which boasts a ticked coat giving them a shimmering, sandy appearance. Others, such as light brown Siamese or Burmese variants, may display this color in a softer "chocolate point" or "champagne" shade, often accompanied by striking green or gold eyes. These, and similar shades of light brown tabby cats, are known for being highly affectionate, social, and sometimes possessing a "sassy" or high-energy personality that makes them engaging, active household companions.</p>
