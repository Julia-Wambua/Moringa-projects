   <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
   <h2>Created with the help of Moringa School</h2>
   
   
   <p>This webpage is a project aimed at putting the introductory skills taught at Moringa School into practice.
      Some of these skills inlude:

      <ul>
         <li>CSS styling</li>
         <li>Creation of html and css files</li>
         <li>Linking html files to css files</li>
      </ul>
   </p>

   

    <div>
       <h2>Here are some examples of already created webpages:</h2>

       <p>The web design part of the introduction to software engineering program equips learners with basics skills
          that are in high demand among various employers, hence helping them sell themselves in the job market, thus
          making it easier for them to gain employment.
       </p>

       <p>In addition, web design equips the designer with great keenness and technical skills which may be applied in
          many other fields such as medicine and engineering in general.It is because of this that I find webpage design
          an indisposable skill for one to have in their arsenal as it helps them both in the present and in the days to
          come.
